## Cafeteria Food Ordering App 


### Problem Statement:
In the past 2 years, social distancing has become a religion for the world, and ordering food online and takeaways have seen a great rise. 
Zomato and Swiggy acted like a lifeboat for all the restaurants and coffee shops. 
But sadly, there has been no Mobile Application made to order food for takeaway or at home for the college cafeterias and canteens. 
Students have missed those delicious snacks and munches from their college canteen, either due to not being able to reach the destination or from fear of no social distancing.


### Proposed Solution:
To solve this major problem to help the canteen vendors and help students get their all-time favorite food, this project proposes ‘Canteen 4U’, 
an innovative yet easy to use Mobile Application made for the students and canteen vendors, for food takeaways to help students maintain social distancing and 
also enjoy their favorite food. The features include placing an order for your desired food and live to track the order. 
The app first asks for OTP sign-up and registration, then redirects the user to the canteen menu they use to cherish before the pandemic. 
The students can add their desired items to a food cart and order the food online. 
After the order has been placed the vendor will receive the order and start preparing the same for takeaway. 
It solves the major problem of social distancing by informing students when the order is ready for takeaway. 
The project looks to start online food delivery being the long-term goal.



### Functionality & Concepts used:
The App has a very simple and interactive interface that helps the students select their favorite food and track their current/past order. 
Following are a few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in the app:

  1. Constraint Layout: Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
  2. Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without 
  providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also use App Navigation to switch between screens of menu and order history.
  3. Recycler-View:  To present the available menu items and the user order history to show the user his/her past orders and track the current order. 
  Also, the recycler-view is used on the owner's side of the app for displaying all the orders that are placed. 
  4. LiveData & Room Database: We are also using LiveData to update the status of the order and show the same to the user. 
  The status can be updated from the owner's side of the app as and when the order is ready/completed or canceled.


### Application Link & Future Scope:
The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase with DYPCOE, akurdi with a limited no. of users, you can access the app: https://github.com/AdityaB1152/Android-Study-Jams
Once the app is fully tested and functional in DYPCOE university, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this food catering app. We aim that by next year most of the colleges in our district will use our canteen food ordering app for students to order their favorite food from the respective college canteen. Also, we are planning to include online food delivery at the doorstep of the consumer.
